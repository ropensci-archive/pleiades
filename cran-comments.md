## Reverse dependencies

There are no reverse dependencies.

---

This version updates dependencies and changes internals accordingly
for those new deps, due to changes in dplyr.

I noticed that on winbuilder R-devel there is an odd error about EOF, 
but it builds fine without problems on winbuilder R-release, so I 
assume itâ€™s okay.

Thanks!
